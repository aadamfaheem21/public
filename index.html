  <h1>OMG - A Quiz!</h1>
  <ol>
  <li>The number one thing that I have learned so far is the history of the internet.
  I liked learning how it was very staggered in its development, and it wasn't all at once.</li>
  <li>I also liked learning more about how webpages work. Looking at css styling at the frontend
  of the websites was very cool.</li>
  <li>Lastly, I learned how dev tools can be useful when looking at css. I never thought that
    dev tools would be useful, and was more for having fun messing around with websites</li>
  </ol>
